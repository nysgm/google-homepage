The current project that I am doing is to deconstruct a webpage and then rebuild the webpage. 
What I demonstrated in the project:
1. I split the google homepage into three separate sections: nav, body and footer.
2. Mainly used lots of div elements so I could style them separately with CSS.
3. Used lots of lists within separate div elements.
4. Used a mixture of float and position properties to move stuff around the page.

What I learned from the project:
1. Studying other people's code examples helped a lot with the CSS side of things.
2. It is very easy to make mistakes throughout your code and thus you should check it regularly.
3. There is still a lot I don't know about HTML and CSS but having references and Google is very helpful!
